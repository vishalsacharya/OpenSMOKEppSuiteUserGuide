\begin_layout Title
The OpenSMOKE++ Suite
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE++
\family default
 is a general framework for numerical simulations of reacting systems with
 detailed kinetic mechanisms, including thousands of chemical species and
 reactions.
 The framework is entirely written in object-oriented C++ and can be easily
 extended and customized by the user for specific systems, without having
 to modify the core functionality of the program.
 The 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE++
\family default
 framework can handle simulations of ideal chemical reactors (plug-flow,
 batch, and jet stirred reactors), shock-tubes, rapid compression machines,
 and can be easily incorporated into multi-dimensional CFD codes for the
 modeling of reacting flows.
 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE++
\family default
 provides useful numerical tools such as the sensitivity and rate of production
 analyses, needed to recognize the main chemical paths and to interpret
 the numerical results from a kinetic point of view.
 Since simulations involving large kinetic mechanisms are very time consuming,
 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE++
\family default
 adopts advanced numerical techniques able to reduce the computational cost,
 without sacrificing the accuracy and the robustness of the calculations.

\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE++ Suite
\family default
 is a collection of "standard solvers" for performing kinetic analyses with
 detailed kinetic mechanisms, with hundreds of species and thousands of
 reactions.
 The word "solver" has to be intended as an independent program, built with
 the aim to perform a specific task (for example to simulate a batch reactor,
 or to model a shock-wave, etc.
 ).
 Thus, in the following, the 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE++ Suite
\family default
 definition will be used to refer to the collection of 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE++
\family default
 standard solvers.
 The list of available solvers (which is continuously growing) includes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
a kinetic pre-processor, a utility which is able to read, pre-process and
 analyze kinetic mechanisms written in the CHEMKIN format.
 Its main purpose is to rewrite the kinetic scheme in a XML format which
 can be efficiently used by the 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE++ Suite
\family default
 solvers;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
a collection of solvers (i.e.
 independent executable files), one for each system to simulate.
 In other words, the 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE++ Suite
\family default
 provides the solver dedicated to the simulation of plug flow reactors,
 the solver dedicated to the simulation of batch reactors, and so on.
 These solvers are completely independent from each other, but need the
 same pre-processed kinetic mechanism in XML format generated by the kinetic
 pre-processor described above;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
a graphical post-processor, to easily post-process the simulation results.
 It is able not only to plot the usual profiles of temperature, pressure,
 composition, etc.
 along the time or space coordinate, but it is extremely useful to rapidly
 perform sensitivity analyses, rate of production analyses, and to draw
 flux diagrams.

\begin_layout Section
How the OpenSMOKE++ Solvers work 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE++ Suite
\family default
 solvers, together with the kinetic pre-processor, do not have any graphical
 interface.
 They are based on input files in ASCII format.
 Only the graphical post-processor is works with a GUI (Graphical User Interface
), based on the QT libraries.
 This means that if you want to pre-process a kinetic mechanism (together
 with the thermodynamic and transport properties) or you want to simulate
 a reactor, your input conditions must be provided through one or more input
 files.
 These are simple ASCII files which can be written and modified using a
 generic text editor, like Notepad, Notepad++, Microsoft Word, gedit, etc.
 In the following lines, an example of perfectly stirred reactor is reported:

 keyword.
 A comment can be inserted at the beginning or in the middle of a line.
 Every word or number reported after the 
\family typewriter
//
\family default
 keyword is considered as a comment and ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The input data must be organized in Dictionaries, i.e.
 homogeneous input data have to be collected together in the same structure
 (see the example above).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each dictionary is defined by the 
\family typewriter
Dictionary
\family default
 word, followed by the name of the dictionary.
 The options belonging to this dictionary have to be reported between the
 
\family typewriter
{
\family default
 and the 
\family typewriter
}
\family default
 symbols.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each keyword begins with the 
\family typewriter
@
\family default
 symbol, usually requires one or more options (bool variables, number, strings,
 etc.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each input line must end with the 
\family typewriter
;
\family default
 symbol.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the example reported above, which refers to a steady-state, perfectly
 stirred reactor, two different dictionaries were defined, with names equal
 to 
\family typewriter
PerfectlyStirredReactor
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
Inlet-Composition
\family default
, respectively.
 In each of these two dictionaries, several input data are specified through
 different keywords.
 The available options depend on the solver you are using.

Selection of thermodynamic data and kinetic mechanism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to run simulations with 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE++ Suite
\family default
 solvers, the user needs a kinetic scheme describing the homogeneous (gas-phase)
 and, optionally, also the heterogeneous (surface) reactions, and the thermodyna
mic properties for each species included in the kinetic mechanism.
 The current version of 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE++
\family default
 requires that the kinetic scheme, together with the thermodynamic and (optional
ly) transport properties, is provided in the CHEMKIN format.
 Kinetic mechanisms and thermodynamic and transport data in CHEMKIN-compatible
 format are available from several research groups.
 In particular, a non exaustive list is reported in the following:

Sensitivity analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE++ Suite 
\family default
provides several useful tools to perform sensitivity analysis, both for
 unsteady and steady-state problems.
 Sensitivity analysis is very important for kinetic studies, since it allows
 the quantitative understanding of how the numerical solution of the governing
 equations depends on the various parameters contained in the model itself.
 Only the first-order sensitivity coefficients with respect to the reaction
 rate coefficients (pre-exponential factors, activation energy or kinetic
 constant) can be calculated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the calculation of first-order sensitivity coefficient is very time
 consuming, the user has to request explicitly the sensitivity analysis
 before running the simulation.
 Thus, in order to perform the sensitivity analysis we have to modify the
 
\family typewriter
batch.dic
\family default
 file, by adding a new dictionary:

Kinetic pre-processor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to preprocess a kinetic scheme, the 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE++ Suite
\family default
 provides the 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE_CHEMKIN_PreProcessor
\family default
 utility.
 The user has to supply the files containing the thermodynamic data, the
 kinetic mechanism, and (optionally) the transport data.
 For the simulation of ideal reactors, usually the transport data are not
 needed and therefore the user could choose to preprocess only the thermodynamic
 and the kinetic data.
 This is useful, since in many cases the transport data are not available.
 In order to run the 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE_CHEMKIN_PreProcessor
\family default
 utility, the user has to write an input file containing the instructions
 (i.e.
 the dictionary) to perform the preprocessing and/or additional useful operation
s (checking of the thermodynamic properties, post-processing of reaction
 rates, etc.).
 The rules to write the dictionary are reported in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Dictionary-CHEMKIN-PreProcessor"

\end_inset

.
 Please look at the tutorials to have more details.
 The 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE_CHEMKIN_PreProcessor
\family default
 utility can be run from the command line using the following instructions,
 where it is assumed that the file containing the dictionary is called 
\family typewriter
myinput.dic

 six different solvers are available:

Dictionary: CHEMKIN-PreProcessor 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This dictionary is used by the 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE_CHEMKIN_Preprocessor
\family default
 solver with the aim to preprocess (i.e.
 interpret) a kinetic mechanism written in the standard CHEMKIN format.
 Only the thermodynamic file is strictly necessary, but, obviously, a kinetic
 mechanism must be provided if the aim is to perform simulations of reacting
 systems.
 For most of the ideal reactors no transport data are required and therefore
 the user could choose to pre-process only the thermodynamic and the kinetic
 files.
 According to the specified options, additional analysis can be easily and
 rapidly performed.
 Please consider that the kinetic and thermodynamic data must be always
 provided in two different files (i.e.
 the thermodynamic data cannot be added to the same file where the kinetic
 scheme is written).

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
@KineticsFolder 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This option is used to specify the name of the folder containing the kinetic
 scheme in XML Version (
\family typewriter
kinetics.xml
\family default
).
 This file has to be generated using the 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE_CHEMKIN_Preprocessor
\family default
.
 Instead of using this option, the user has the possibility to pre-process
 the kinetic scheme on the fly using the 
\family typewriter
@KineticsPreProcessor
\family default
 option (see below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
@KineticsPreProcessor 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The user can pre-process a kinetic scheme available in CHEMKIN format on
 the fly, when the reactor simulation is performed (instead of pre-processing
 the kinetics in a previous step).
 This option is very useful when the kinetic mechanism is under construction
 and/or tuning and the user has the need to change often the reactions and
 the kinetic parameters.
 Please consider that the pre-processing operation can be quite long for
 very detailed kinetic schemes (thousands of species).
 The 
\family typewriter
@KineticsPreProcessor
\family default
 option requires that the user specify the name of the sub-dictionary containing
 all the information needed to pre-process kinetic mechanisms on the fly.
 Please look at Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Sub-Dictionary-Rapid-Kinetics"

\end_inset

 to have more details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
@InitialStatus 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This option is used to specify the features (temperature, pressure and compositi
on) of the initial mixture (i.e.
 at time 0) in the batch reactor.
 The 
\family typewriter
@InitialStatus
\family default
 option requires that the user specify the name of the corresponding sub-diction
ary.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
@KineticsFolder 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This option is used to specify the name of the folder containing the kinetic
 scheme in XML Version (
\family typewriter
kinetics.xml
\family default
).
 This file has to be generated using the 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE_CHEMKIN_Preprocessor
\family default
.
 Instead of using this option, the user has the possibility to pre-process
 the kinetic scheme on the fly using the 
\family typewriter
@KineticsPreProcessor
\family default
 option (see below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
@KineticsPreProcessor 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The user can pre-process a kinetic scheme available in CHEMKIN format on
 the fly, when the reactor simulation is performed (instead of pre-processing
 the kinetics in a previous step).
 This option is very useful when the kinetic mechanism is under construction
 and/or tuning and the user has the need to change often the reactions and
 the kinetic parameters.
 Please consider that the pre-processing operation can be quite long for
 very detailed kinetic schemes (thousands of species).
 The 
\family typewriter
@KineticsPreProcessor
\family default
 option requires that the user specify the name of the sub-dictionary containing
 all the information needed to pre-process kinetic mechanisms on the fly.
 Please look at Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Sub-Dictionary-Rapid-Kinetics"

\end_inset

 to have more details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
@Type 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This option is used to specify the type of reactor to simulate.
 Two different combinations are possible: 
\family typewriter
Isothermal-ConstantPressure
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
NonIsothermal-ConstantPressure
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
@InletStatus 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This option is used to specify the features (temperature, pressure and compositi
on) of the inlet mixture in the perfectly stirred reactor.
 The 
\family typewriter
@InletStatus
\family default
 option requires that the user specify the name of the corresponding sub-diction
ary.
 Please look at Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 to have more details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
@InitialStatus 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This option is used to specify the features (temperature, pressure and compositi
on) of the initial mixture (i.e.
 at time 0) in the perfectly stirred reactor.
 This information is used only as a first guess solution to find the steady-stat
e solution.
 The 
\family typewriter
@InitialStatus
\family default
 option requires that the user specify the name of the corresponding sub-diction
ary.
 Please look at Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Sub-Dictionary-Gas-Status"

\end_inset

 to have more details.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the residence time of the perfectly stirred reactor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
@EndTime 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the integration time for the solution of the ODE system.
 Since the user is interested in steady-state conditions, this number must
 be extremely large.
 The default value is 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{6}$
\end_inset

 s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
@Volume

@KineticsFolder 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This option is used to specify the name of the folder containing the kinetic
 scheme in XML Version (
\family typewriter
kinetics.xml
\family default
).
 This file has to be generated using the 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE_CHEMKIN_Preprocessor
\family default
.
 Instead of using this option, the user has the possibility to pre-process
 the kinetic scheme on the fly using the 
\family typewriter
@KineticsPreProcessor
\family default
 option (see below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
@KineticsPreProcessor 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The user can pre-process a kinetic scheme available in CHEMKIN format on
 the fly, when the reactor simulation is performed (instead of pre-processing
 the kinetics in a previous step).
 This option is very useful when the kinetic mechanism is under construction
 and/or tuning and the user has the need to change often the reactions and
 the kinetic parameters.
 Please consider that the pre-processing operation can be quite long for
 very detailed kinetic schemes (thousands of species).
 The 
\family typewriter
@KineticsPreProcessor
\family default
 option requires that the user specify the name of the sub-dictionary containing
 all the information needed to pre-process kinetic mechanisms on the fly.
 Please look at Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Sub-Dictionary-Rapid-Kinetics"

\end_inset

 to have more details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*

@KineticsFolder 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This option is used to specify the name of the folder containing the kinetic
 scheme in XML Version (
\family typewriter
kinetics.xml
\family default
).
 This file has to be generated using the 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE_CHEMKIN_Preprocessor
\family default
.
 Instead of using this option, the user has the possibility to pre-process
 the kinetic scheme on the fly using the 
\family typewriter
@KineticsPreProcessor
\family default
 option (see below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
@KineticsPreProcessor 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The user can pre-process a kinetic scheme available in CHEMKIN format on
 the fly, when the reactor simulation is performed (instead of pre-processing
 the kinetics in a previous step).
 This option is very useful when the kinetic mechanism is under construction
 and/or tuning and the user has the need to change often the reactions and
 the kinetic parameters.
 Please consider that the pre-processing operation can be quite long for
 very detailed kinetic schemes (thousands of species).
 The 
\family typewriter
@KineticsPreProcessor
\family default
 option requires that the user specify the name of the sub-dictionary containing
 all the information needed to pre-process kinetic mechanisms on the fly.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
@OdeSolver
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The user can choose among differen ODE solvers.
 The OpenSMOKE++ native ODE solver (
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE
\family default
) is quite effective especially with very stiff kinetic mechanisms.
 We suggest to use it when the kinetic mechanisms from CRECK Modeling Group
 are adopted, or more in general for kinetic mechanisms based on the lumped
 procedures.
 The 
\family typewriter
CVODE
\family default
 solver is the first option for very large kinetic mechanisms (thousands
 of species).
 More in general, we suggest to perform some preliminary tests in order
 to find the faster ODE solver for the kinetic mechanism under investigation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
@RelativeTolerance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Relative tolerance (default 1.2e-5).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
@AbsoluteTolerance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Absolute tolerance (default 1.2e-5).
 For 
\family typewriter
CVODE
\family default
 solver we suggest to use stricter bsolute tolerance (i.e.
 at least 1e-14).

\begin_layout Standard
Type of sensitivity analysis.
 In the current version of OpenSMOKE++ the sensitivity anlysis can be performed
 with respect to the frequency factor corresponding to each reaction (
\family typewriter
arrhenius-parameters
\family default
) or with respct to the whole kinetic constant (
\family typewriter

\family default
);

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
@DenseFullPivoting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Full pivoting vs Partial pivoting (LU decomposition).
 The solution of linear systems is the most expensive operation of sensitivity
 analysis.
 In order to speed-up the calculations, a partial pivoting strategy can
 be applied when the LU factorization is applied.

Autoignition of a mixture of hydrogen and air
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tutorial presents a transient simulation of the spontaneous ignition
 of a stoichiometric hydrogen/air mixture at constant pressure.
 This tutorial uses the 
\family typewriter
POLIMI_H2CO_1412
\family default
 kinetic mechanism developed by CRECK Modeling Group at Politecnico di Milano.
 The 
\family typewriter
POLIMI_H2CO_1412
\family default
 mechanism is distributed with the current version of 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE++ Suite
\family default
 or can be downloaded directly from the web site (
\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://creckmodeling.chem.polimi.it/
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Here we are interested in determining the ignition time under a specified
 set of initial pressure and temperature conditions, assuming no heat loss
 to the environment (adiabatic conditions).
 In addition, we would like to determine which reactions contribute most
 to the autoignition process, using sensitivity analysis.
 The system is a closed or batch process, which means there is no flow of
 mass into or out of the reactor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tutorial project is located in the 
\family typewriter
examples
\backslash
autoignition-h2-air
\family default
 directory.
 A single, batch reactor at constant pressure will be simulated.
 The input data are provided though the 
\family typewriter
input.dic
\family default
 file (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Project01-Input-File"

\end_inset

).
 In paticular, the end time of the simulation is set to 0.25 ms.
 The initial temperature is equal to 1000 K and the pressure is kept equal
 to 1 atm (constant pressure).
 The volume is not important for the results of this simulation, so the
 default value of 1 cm3 will be used for the initial volume.
 Since this is a closed homogeneous system, the results in terms of species
 fraction and temperature will be the same, regardless of the volume value.
 If surface chemistry were included, the volume-to-surface ratio would be
 important, but in this case it is gas only.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The starting gas mixture is given in relative moles as 2.0 H2, 1.0 O2, and
 3.76 N2.
 Writing it this way makes it easy to see that the O2/N2 ratio matches the
 composition of air, and that the fuel/air ratio is stoichiometric (two
 H2 per one O2).
 The normalization will occur automatically.
 The sensitivity analysis is enabled and this results in sensitivity coefficient
s being calculated for all species and all reactions and saved in the proper
 XML files.
 As already reported in the previous sections, this option should be used
 with care, as the computation time and solution-file sizes increase as
 a higher power of the size of the reaction mechanism.
 Except in the case of a very small reaction mechanism, such as the one
 being used in the sample problem, it is better to use the 
\family typewriter
@Species
\family default
 option to request that sensitivity coefficients be output only for a few
 species of highest interest.

 At the end of this simulation, the temperature is still rising; if it is
 run much longer, the temperature increases another ~300 K, nearing the
 adiabatic flame temperature.
 Although not shown, the volume in this constant-pressure system shows a
 corresponding increase at ignition.
 The calculated ignition time, defined as the time at which the gas reaches
 a temperature of 1400 K (i.e.
 corresponding to an increase of 400 K), is equal to 0.186 ms.

 shows normalized sensitivity coefficients as a function of time for the
 four reactions that have the largest effect on the gas temperature.
 As one might expect, the largest sensitivity occurs near the time of ignition,
 when the most rapid change in temperature is taking place.
 The results also show that the dominant reaction for determining the temperatur
e during ignition is the exothermic radical-recombination reaction #1: 
\begin_inset Formula $O2+H=O+OH$
\end_inset

.
 The sensitivity coefficient for this reaction is positive, indicating that
 increasing the rate of this reaction will lead to a higher temperature
 (more heat production).
 In contrast, the sensitivity coefficient for reaction #3 is large and negative,
 indicating that increasing the rate of this reaction will lead to a lower
 temperature (less heat production).

\begin_layout Section
Ignition delay times for propane autoignition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This user tutorial presents an ignition-delay time calculation for the homogeneo
us, isobaric, adiabatic combustion of propane in air.
 There are various ways of defining the ignition time, experimentally as
 well as computationally, for combustion applications.
 For example, it is often defined as the time at which either the maximum
 or onset of certain species concentrations is reached, the time at which
 a specified rate of increase of temperature occurs, the time at which luminous
 radiant output from the system is first observed, etc.
 The reported experimental data can vary greatly, depending on which definition
 was used in the experiments.
 Thus, it is often useful to select which ignition-delay time definition
 should be used in numerical computations.
 In this particular example, the ignition times are computed using two distinct
 definitions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
as the time during which the maximum amount of heat is released (as indicated
 by the inflection point in the temperature profile)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
as the time corresponding to the maximum of a certain species (OH in this
 case) concentration
\end_layout

Discrepancies between results are presented.

Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tutorial project is located in the 
\family typewriter
examples
\backslash
autoignition_propane
\family default
 directory.
 A single, batch reactor at constant pressure will be simulated.
 The input data are provided though the 
\family typewriter
input.dic
\family default
 file (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Project02-Input-File"

\end_inset

).
 The initial temperature is equal to 1200 K, while the pressure is kept
 constant and equal to 1 atm.
 The volume is not important for the results of this simulation, so the
 default value of 1 cm3 will be used for the initial volume.
 Since this is an isobaric closed homogeneous system, the results in terms
 of species fraction and temperature will be the same, regardless of the
 volume value.
 If surface chemistry were included, the volume-tosurface ratio would be
 important, but in this case only gas-phase chemistry is present.
 The starting gas mixture is given as 0.02 C3H8, 0.05 O2, and 0.93 Ar.
 These rather dilute conditions are representative of shock-tube experimental
 conditions.
 The end time is specified on through the 
\family typewriter
@EndTime
\family default
 option.
 It is important to check the resulting output file after the run is complete
 to make sure that the 
\family typewriter
@EndTime
\family default
 is large enough to allow for ignition to occur.
 If no ignition time is provided at the end of the output file, ignition
 has not yet occurred and the 
\family typewriter
@EndTime
\family default
 of the simulation should be adjusted.

Simulating a Shock-Tube experiment

Shock tube experiments are often used to obtain chemical kinetic data at
 high temperatures, which is especially relevant to combustion modeling.

 reaction rates at elevated temperatures.
 We can apply the

 Shock Tube solver to validate the reaction mechanism or kinetic parameters
 derived from such experiments.

 They also assembled a reaction mechanism with kinetic parameters derived

\end_inset

).
 To properly incorporate different temperature dependencies for different
 third bodies, we exclude 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 from participating as a third body in the original reaction, i.e., the effective
 third body efficiency for 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is set to zero.
 And we add a new reaction 
\begin_inset Formula $N2+N=N+N$
\end_inset

 to explicitly address the different temperature dependence of nitrogen
 atom as the third body.

Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Setting up a shock tube model requires information from the corresponding
 experiment.
 In addition to the conditions of the initial (unshocked) gas mixture, we
 will need to provide information on the diameter of the shock tube, the
 viscosity of the gas at 300 K, and the velocity of the incident shock.
 If we do not know the shock velocity from the experiment, we can estimate
 it by using the Chapmen-Jouguet detonation model.
 The shock tube diameter and the gas viscosity at 300 K are only required
 when the boundary-layer correction is used in the shock simulation.

).
 In this example, we are considering an incident shock problem with boundary
 layer corrections.
 The unshocked temperature is 296K, the pressure is 6.58E-3 atm, and the
 shock velocity is 2.8E5 cm/sec.
 The initial mole fractions are 0.78118 N2, 0.20948 O2, and 0.00934 Ar.
 The problem will terminate at 200 microseconds.
 The shock tube diameter is 3.81 cm, and the viscosity of the gas at 300K
 is 1.777E-4 gm/cm/s; these parameters are used for the boundary layer correction
s.

 as a function of time.
 The NO mole fraction profile rapidly rises to a peak value then gradually
 falls back to its equilibrium level.
 Reasons for the greater-than-equilibrium peak NO concentration can be found
 in the paper by Camac and Feinberg and references therein.
 The predicted peak NO mole fraction is 0.046 and is in good agreement with
 the measured and the computed data by Camac and Feinberg.

This tutorial presents the simulation of the steady-state combustion of
 a mixture of hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen in an adiabatic perfectly-stirred
 reactor.
 This tutorial uses the 
\family typewriter
POLIMI_H2CO_1412
\family default
 kinetic mechanism developed by CRECK Modeling Group at Politecnico di Milano.
 This project demonstrates the use of parameteric analysis features of 
\family typewriter
OpenSMOKE++ Suite

).
 The residence time of the gas in the PSR is assumed to be 0.03 ms, the volume
 equal to 67.4 cm3, and the pressure is kept constant.
 The inlet temperature is equal to 298 K and the initial gas temperature
 in the PSR is equal to 1800 K.
 No heat loss is taken into account, so the system will be treated as adiabatic.
 No estimate of the gas composition is needed to help the solver converge
 on a solution.
 The fuel stream is composed of 60% H2 and 40% N2.
 The oxidizer is defined as 79% N2 and 21% O2 (air).
 An equivalence ratio of 1 is assumed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A parametric analysis is performed, by studying the effects of pressure
 on the reactor's performances.
 In particular, the pressure was gradually increased from 1 atm to 10 atm.
